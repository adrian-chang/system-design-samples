Design a Scalable URL Shortening Service (e.g., Bitly)

You are tasked with designing a system that allows users to input long URLs and receive a shortened version of the URL. The system should support the following features:

URL Shortening : Users can input a long URL, and the system generates a unique, shortened URL.
URL Redirection : When a user visits the shortened URL, they should be redirected to the original long URL.
Customizable Short URLs : Users should have the option to customize their short URLs (e.g., short.url/mycustomname).
Analytics : The system should track how many times each shortened URL has been accessed.
Scalability : The system should handle millions of requests per day.
Expiration : URLs should optionally expire after a certain period or number of clicks.

Follow-up Questions (to probe deeper):
Database Design : How would you store the mappings between short URLs and long URLs? What database technology would you choose, and why?
Follow-up : How would you handle collisions if two users try to create the same custom short URL?
Scalability : How would you ensure the system scales to handle high traffic? What strategies would you use to distribute load across servers?
Follow-up : How would you handle caching for frequently accessed URLs?
Reliability : How would you ensure the system is highly available and fault-tolerant? What happens if a server goes down?
Security : How would you prevent abuse of the system (e.g., spammy links)? Would you implement rate-limiting or other mechanisms?
Team Management : If you were leading a team to build this system, how would you break down the tasks? How would you ensure smooth collaboration between frontend, backend, and DevOps teams?
Analytics : How would you design the analytics feature to track clicks on shortened URLs? Would you use real-time processing or batch processing? Why?
Expiration Logic : How would you implement the expiration feature? Would you use a background job scheduler or some other mechanism?

Expected Outcomes:
Architecture Diagram : The candidate should be able to sketch out a high-level architecture diagram showing components like:
Web server/API gateway
Load balancer
Database (e.g., relational vs NoSQL)
Caching layer (e.g., Redis)
Background workers (for analytics, expiration, etc.)
Trade-offs : The candidate should discuss trade-offs in their design choices, such as:
Choosing between SQL and NoSQL databases.
Balancing consistency vs availability (CAP theorem).
Trade-offs between real-time vs batch processing for analytics.
Leadership Insights : As an engineering manager, the candidate should also demonstrate how they would lead a team to implement this system, including task breakdown, prioritization, and communication strategies.
